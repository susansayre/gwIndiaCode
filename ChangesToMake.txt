List of changes to make:

1. Get scaling to accurately match the results presented in the paper
2. Change the comparative statics on the modern farm to be increase in demand at current levels and rotate around this point
3. Consider downward time trend on investment costs so that optimal management doesn't involve immediate conversion
4. Run one simulation with very high investment cost and low std dev so that no farms invest -- let's us say how much of the effect is due to the option to convert
5. Consider truncated investment costs so that costs don't go negative
6. Longer and/or more sophisticated time trends
7. Improved transitioning from full investment to none in the optimal control problem
